#### Work Stream 3: Temporal Reasoning and Situational Awareness

**Background & challenges:** Most social applications, be it summarisation of long documents (e.g. court cases, therapy sessions) or dialogue, require contextual awareness, both in terms of temporal and situational reasoning, shown to be lacking in LLMs. Specifically LLMs lag behind human performance and even small-scale specialised models on tasks such as temporal ordering of timelines, satisfaction of temporal constraints (before and after) and common sense knowledge about events.

<br>

**Foci & implementation:** To mitigate shortcomings in temporal and situational awareness we will investigate instruction fine-tuning for temporal relations and use-case relevant situations informed by domain experts and responsible AI principles. We will also investigate: personalisation strategies during both pre-training and fine-tuning; hybrid architectures combining & augmenting LLMs with smaller specialised models and symbolic reasoning, the injection of temporal information into neural architectures, including both transformers and novel architectures better at handling sequential data. The effectiveness of developed methods for improving temporal reasoning will be evaluated intrinsically against known benchmarks, and the benchmark from Work Stream 2, and extrinsically in terms of their impact on summary quality for the legal and mental health use cases. The temporal reasoning & situational awareness methods will also feed into and be evaluated in the dialogue (Work Stream 4) and monitoring tasks (Work Stream 5).

**Outputs:** We will develop world-leading pioneering **methods, code, publications for augmenting temporal situational reasoning in LLMs** to be used by researchers in industry and academia alike. These will enable time and situation aware summarisation and dialogue prototypes.
