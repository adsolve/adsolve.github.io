A well-established area of research in Natural Language Processing, drawing from well-understood concepts in linguistic and computational linguistic research, the field has recently seen a lot of interest as a result of the surge of text, video, and audio available on the web, which in turn require ways of summarising and categorizing the mole of content for which linear text segmentation is a fundamental step. In this survey, we provide an extensive overview of current advances in linear text segmentation, describing the state of the art in terms of resources and approaches for the task. Finally, we highlight the limitations of available resources and of the task itself, while indicating ways forward based on the most recent literature and under-explored research directions.}

To advance research in this area, we collected 1,000 real-world consumer dialogues with ambiguous references. This dataset will be used for subsequent studies to identify ambiguous references and generate responses. Our analysis of the dataset revealed common strategies employed by service staff, including directly asking clarification questions (CQ) and listing possible options before asking a clarification question (LCQ). However, we found that merely using CQ often fails to fully satisfy customers. In contrast, using LCQ, as well as recommending specific products after listing possible options, proved more effective in resolving ambiguous references and enhancing customer satisfaction.}

On this front both context and time dynamics as well as their interplay are of prime importance. Current approaches model context via pre-trained representations, which are typically temporally agnostic. Previous work on modelling context and temporal dynamics has used recurrent methods, which are slow and prone to overfitting. Here we introduce TempoFormer, the first task-agnostic transformer-based and temporally-aware model for dynamic representation learning. Our approach is jointly trained on inter and intra context dynamics and introduces a novel temporal variation of rotary positional embeddings. The architecture is flexible and can be used as the temporal representation foundation of other models or applied to different transformer-based architectures. We show new SOTA performance on three different real-time change detection tasks.}

We present a new task, that of segmenting radiology reports into topically meaningful passages (segments) and a transformer-based model that both segments reports into semantically coherent segments and classifies each segment using a set of 37 radiological abnormalities, thus enabling fine-grained analysis. This contrasts with prior work that performs classification on full reports without localisation. Trained on over 2.7 million unlabelled chest X-ray reports and over 28k segmented and labelled reports, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on report segmentation (0.0442 WinDiff) and multi-label classification (0.84 report-level macro F1) over 37 radiological labels and 8 NLP-specific labels. This work establishes new benchmarks for fine-grained understanding of free-text radiology reports, with precise localisation of semantics unlocking new opportunities to improve computer vision model training and clinical decision support. We open-source our annotation tool, model code and pretrained weights to encourage future research.}

We advance the state-of-the-art on the PHEME dataset, which consists of Twitter response threads collected as a rumour was unfolding. We automatically collect evidence relevant to PHEME and use it to construct knowledge graphs in a time-sensitive manner, excluding information post-dating rumour emergence. We identify discrepancies between the evidence retrieved and PHEME`s labels, which are discussed in detail and amended to release an updated dataset. We develop a novel knowledge graph approach which finds paths linking disjoint fragments of evidence. Our rumour verification model which combines evidence from the graph outperforms the state-of-the-art on PHEME and has superior generisability when evaluated on a temporally distant rumour verification dataset.}
