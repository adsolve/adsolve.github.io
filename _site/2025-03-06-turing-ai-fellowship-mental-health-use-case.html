                    <h2>Overview</h2>

                    <p>Our joint event took place on March 6th 2025.</p>

                    <p>The morning session covered research in creating time sensitive sensors for mental health from
                        Prof. Maria Liakata’s <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/time-sensitive-sensing-language-and-user-generated-content">Turing
                            AI Fellowship</a>, including presentations on identifying of moments of
                        change with TempoFormer by Talia Tseriotou, capturing timelines and identifying changes with
                        neural Hawkes processes by Anthony Hills, timeline summarisation and improving temporal
                        reasoning by Jiayu Song, framework and benchmark for reasoning limitations in LLMs by Mahmud
                        Akhter, evaluation of synthetic language data and LLMs by Jenny Chim, and a dashboard for
                        mental health monitoring by Sebastian Lobbers.</p>
                    <p>The afternoon began with talks by Dr. Becky Inkster, who presented on multi-modal data for mental
                        health citizen science, and Prof. Dana Slonim, who presented about the MIND framework, the
                        CLPsych 2025 shared task, and work at the intersection of AI and psychotherapy in her lab. Next,
                        Dr. Onno Kampman gave an overview about AI applications implemented by the MOH Office for
                        Healthcare Transformation (MOHT) in Singapore. Dr. Jen Martin from
                        MindTech gave a talk about <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PTNUYdt04tooIUNA6ZAYF4fcpdThXRO-">the potentials,
                            priorities, and barriers to using AI to
                            address unmet needs in mental health</a>. Finally, from the AdSoLve project team, Prof.
                        Domenico Giacco from the University of Warwick presented about <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jICIaQUtnP92aLWZaeEs7-kWPsiQo5UW">the AI-DIALOG+
                            system</a>.</p>
                    <p>The talks were followed by an introduction to the project’s evaluation platform and structured
                        discussions around requirement identification on two use cases: (1) Summarisation for therapy
                        sessions, and (2) Dialogue for self-management.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>(1) Summarisation for therapy sessions</b></p>
                    <p>The group examined different summary types and their specific requirements. For example,
                        summaries may be client-facing or therapist-facing, and can be used for session preparation or
                        supervision. The group emphasised that the intended use should be clearly defined when
                        developing and evaluating LLM summaries.</p>
                    <p>Common elements across document types include capturing session content, planned tasks (both new
                        and from previous sessions), and information pertaining to treatment planning and medication
                        changes. LLM-generated summaries should exclude sensitive information but may include expected
                        treatment trajectories for comparison with baselines. The group stressed that language precision
                        is essential, avoiding exaggeration, understatement or irrelevant details. Client-facing
                        summaries should minimise jargon and speculation while incorporating explanations for decisions,
                        such as why medication was adjusted. Supervision-focused summaries should follow a structured
                        format to ensure all key elements are included.</p>
                    <p>Several key challenges were identified: maintaining high factual precision without sacrificing
                        recall; explicitly stating missing details (e.g., "no mention of self-harm"), which may not be
                        well captured by standard summarisation metrics; documenting both positive and negative changes;
                        and understanding how AI-driven components impact clinician workflow and downstream processes.
                    </p>
                    <p>The group also discussed conditional summarisation, where summaries focus on specific aspects,
                        such as information relevant to a particular treatment or intervention. They explored AI's
                        potential to augment existing documentation by citing specific session details to justify
                        medical decisions (often missing in current therapist notes) and helping identify and reinforce
                        positive interventions in cases where therapists might have concentrated more on reducing
                        negative emotions rather than amplifying beneficial patterns.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b>(2) Dialogue for self-management</b></p>
                    <p>The group examined how the system should engage with patients, noting that interaction style
                        affects user experience, patient engagement, platform perception, and intervention
                        effectiveness. The discussion covered key aspects of interaction including appropriate
                        responsiveness to user input, the importance of non-judgmental communication, and the need for
                        systems to provide rationales and context for their responses. The group highlighted concerns
                        about turn-taking dynamics, noting that instant lengthy responses could overwhelm users while
                        also acknowledging the technical challenges in mimicking human pauses.</p>
                    <p>The group emphasised system accountability limitations, stressing that AI must never make
                        clinical decisions and should set clear expectations about its capabilities. Requirements
                        included avoiding feigned understanding, refraining from diagnosis or clinical labelling, not
                        making decisions for users, and allowing users to shift topics and opt out of difficult
                        discussions without coercion. Relatedly, the group highlighted severity-dependent requirements,
                        noting that appropriate interactions vary significantly between normal days and crisis
                        situations. The system should have a triage function, or at least it must know to escalate to
                        human experts when necessary.</p>
                    <p>The group identified conversation memory as a "must have" feature, enabling continuity across
                        sessions for coherent therapeutic experiences and proper tracking of patient progression. This
                        ties in with legal requirements regarding what data is necessary to process and store.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the introduction of AI as a third actor in therapeutic settings raised important
                        questions about transparency and alliance. The group questioned whether therapists should be
                        required to disclose how AI tools influence their assessments and decision-making, and how this
                        tripartite relationship might affect the trust between client and therapist.</p>
